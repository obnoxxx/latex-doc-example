\section*{Introduction}

This is an example document written in {\LaTeX}, Leslie Lamport's typesetting
sysyem.

The main philosphy behind {\LaTeX}---in contrast to most word processors--- is to allow and encourage the author to
focus on the content of the text rather than on the layout and formatting.

writing documents in {\LaTeX} is a bit like programming: One writes a ``source code'' document with the content inplain text
interspersed with some {\LaTeX} commands
and then ``compiles'' or processes it with the processor commands \verb|latex| or \verb|dflatex| to produce
putput files in formats like \textbf{PDF} or {TeX}' own device independent format \textbf{DVI}.


some more introductory words.
And this is already the end of the introduction.




\section{Beginnings}
\label{sec:beginnings}

This first section explains and demonstrates some concepts of {\LaTeX}.

Paragraphs are automatically created from blocks of text separated by one or more
blank lines.


\paragraph{} Some more text goes here in a new paragraph.
Stil confused how the paragraph separation really works?
New paragraphs can also be started explicitly with the \verb|\paragraph{}| command.



\paragraph{} Section headers and other structure elements are automatically formatted and numered
if one uses the corresponding commands like \verb|\section|, \verb|\chapter|, and
so on.


\paragraph{} As {\LaTeX} is based on Donald E. Knuth's {\TeX},
Writing math formulae is rather easy. in the \verb|equation| environment.
Here is an example:


\begin{equation}
\label{eq:example}
\sum_{i=1}^{n}i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\end{equation}

\section{Continuation}

\paragraph{}One big strength of {\LaTeX} is the ability to automatically create a table of contents from the
structure elements. Another is the ability to reference sections and other numerable elements like formulae
and images in the text. Example: Section \textbf{Beginnings} has number \ref{sec:beginnings}.
Equation \ref{eq:example} is the numbered example equation.





and with this, our little example document already comes to an end.
